Description: IMVU Statistics gathering/forwarding/aggregating/storage Server
 The istatd-server package is installed on the host that servers as the
 datastore for data gathered by istatd agents and forwarded to the istatd 
 server.
 .
 The istatd-server also includes an http html ui and json interface to view
 collected system data.
 .
 It is recommended that the istatd-agent package also be instead on the 
 istatd server host so that system data about the istatd server host can
 be stored in istatd datastore.
